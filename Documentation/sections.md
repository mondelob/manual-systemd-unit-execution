# Unit Sections

All units can have two standard sections: **[Unit]** and **[Install]**.
We should differ *unit* and *[UNIT]*; the first are a type of 
configuration file in systemd environment, the second one is a section
inside the unit file. All type of units can also implement it's own
sections, like **[Socket]** in socket units or **[Mount]** in mount
units.
